# Overview

Technology is constantly evolving. Even for languages such as Python, the software involved in this High-Level language is being updated by engineers every few months, or quicker! I hope through this project to be in a mode of contiinuous learning, to improve my ability to set and follow through on my goals, and to improve my ability to communicate through mediums such as GitHub, so that I may market my abilities to joing the workforce!

# Software

For this project, the chosen Higher-Level Language is Python, and the medium through which to code is Visual Studio Code, and the medium to publish is GitHub.

# Purpose
My purpose in doing this project is to demonstrate a basic understanding of the Python language through a common "Hello World" method. It is also to further my understanding of GitHub and its operation, as well as to keep the various programs that bring it all together up to date.

# Development Environment

* Python Version 3.10.11 - To be used to write code for my Hello World Project.
* Visual Studio Code - As the medium chosen to write the code.
* Git/GitHub - As the medium chosen to display my code for public viewing.

The coding language used is python, which as a language has been described as simplistic, easy to read, easy to use, and versatile as a language. It's become a rather popular language to use and is utilized is various fields study and industry including such things as Web Development, Data Science, Artificial Intelligence, and so forth.
